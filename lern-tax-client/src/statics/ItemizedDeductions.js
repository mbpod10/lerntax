      <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040sa.pdf">Schedule A</a>

      <p>
        Some taxpayers, usually homeowners, opt to take Itemized Deductions
        instead of the Standard Deduction. Since the Tax And Jobs Act of 2017,
        fewer people itemized because of the increased standard deduction as
        well as the cap on state and local tax deductions. Itemized deductions
        are calculated on Schedule A and have various sections. Let's take a
        look.
        <b>
          <i>
            Note: when doing your taxes, you can only take the standard
            deduction or the itemized deduction, not both.

                Tax law states that anything above 7.5% of you gross income
                could qualify as a itemized deduction. In other words, if you
                had $100,000 in AGI, you would need over $7,500 in
                unreimbursable medical expenses. Even then, the deductible
                portion would only be in excess of $7,500. Therefore, in the
                above example, one who had $7,501 in unreimbursable medical
                expenses would only be allow to deduct $1.

                In this section, taxpayers have the option to choose to deduct
                general sales tax OR state income tax. Instead of state and
                local income taxes paid, individual taxpayers may choose to

                This is where the controversy comes in. A taxpayer may only
                deduct at a cap of $10,000 of their total state and local taxes.
                So if a taxpayer in New Jersey pays $10,500 in state income tax
                and $14,000 in real estate tax, he or she may only be allowed to
                deduct $10,000 as $10,000 is the smaller of $24,000 and $10,000.

                the donation. If another taxpayer makes one contribution of

                Such donations are in the form of volunteer work and property
                donations. Volunteer deductions are generally classified as
                out-of-pocket expenses while volunteering. Peronsal property
                donations are different in that if the taxpayer did not hold
                onto the asset for one year, the cost of acquiring the property
                is deductible. If it was held for more than one year, the value
                at the time of the donation is deductible. As an example, two
                taxpayers acquire stock in ABC worth $1,000. Taxpayer A held
                onto the stock for more than one year and when donates the stock
                it is worth $2,000 and may deduct the full $2,000. Taxpayer B
                did not wait a whole year and therefore can only take a $1,000
                deduction despite being valued at $2,000 at the time of the
                donations.
