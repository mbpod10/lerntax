      <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040sa.pdf">Schedule A</a>

      <p>
        Some taxpayers, usually homeowners, opt to take Itemized Deductions
        instead of the Standard Deduction. Since the Tax And Jobs Act of 2017,
        fewer people itemized because of the increased standard deduction as
        well as the cap on state and local tax deductions. Itemized deductions
        are calculated on Schedule A and have various sections. Let's take a
        look.
        <b>
          <i>
            Note: when doing your taxes, you can only take the standard
            deduction or the itemized deduction, not both.

                Tax law states that anything above 7.5% of you gross income
                could qualify as a itemized deduction. In other words, if you
                had $100,000 in AGI, you would need over $7,500 in
                unreimbursable medical expenses. Even then, the deductible
                portion would only be in excess of $7,500. Therefore, in the

                This is where the controversy comes in. A taxpayer may only
                deduct at a cap of $10,000 of their total state and local taxes.
                So if a taxpayer in New Jersey pays $10,500 in state income tax

                Such donations are in the form of volunteer work and property
                donations. Volunteer deductions are generally classified as
                out-of-pocket expenses while volunteering. Peronsal property
                donations are different in that if the taxpayer did not hold
                onto the asset for one year, the cost of acquiring the property
                is deductible. If it was held for more than one year, the value
                at the time of the donation is deductible. As an example, two
                taxpayers acquire stock in ABC worth $1,000. Taxpayer A held
                onto the stock for more than one year and when donates the stock
                it is worth $2,000 and may deduct the full $2,000. Taxpayer B
                did not wait a whole year and therefore can only take a $1,000
